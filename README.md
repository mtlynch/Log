Log processing
=============

For the past three years, I have backed up all my IM logs. At the time, I didn't really know why. I thought that maybe one day I would want to read something again. Well, my logs have 150Mb now and I probably won't be reading through it any time soon.

But this year I did two courses on Coursera, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, that started to make me think. Maybe I could build some tools to help me analyze my logs and process some meaningfull information out of them. What information is that? I don't know yet. But it's a work in progress.

Roadmap
-------
1. Process the logs of various IM programs
   * Process Digsby logs
   * Process Trillian logs
   * Process Pidgin logs
   * Process Whatsapp emailed chats
   * Process Facebook takeout data
   * Process Hangouts takeout data
2. Store the logs as efficiently as possible
3. Make pretty graphs out of evolution of most popular contacts
4. Most common words
5. Figure out clusters in my contacts
6. To infinity and beyond

Instructions 
------------
Facebook messages from the takeout data should be prettified. The HTML output is
more consistent then and easier to parse.
